The change is applicable to 32 bit and 64 bit Windows platforms.
Notifications about disabled Java and restoring prompts
The installer notifies you if Java content is disabled in web browsers, and provides instructions for enabling it.

The installer may ask you to reboot your computer if you chose not to restart an internet browser when it prompted you to do so.
